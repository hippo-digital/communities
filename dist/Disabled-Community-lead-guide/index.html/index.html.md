# Disabled Community lead guide

This guide is for people looking after the community.

## What to do if someone asks to join the community

1. Ask the person to review and agree to the [community rules](/Disabled-Community-Rules/)

If they donâ€™t agree or prefer not to join consider point them towards the [#inclusive-design Slack channel](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C01J9S6E2Q2).

2. If they agree to the rules, invite them to the:

* [#disabled-hippos Slack channel](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C03SHCHFU1W).
* [Disabled Hippos Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/hippodigital.co.uk/g/disabled-hippos) - mainly used for organising meetings easier
