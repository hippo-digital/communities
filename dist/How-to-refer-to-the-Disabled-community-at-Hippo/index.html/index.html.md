# How to refer to the Disabled community at Hippo

## When talking about one member

Ask that person what they call themselves.

### Why?

While there are common ways for people to refer to groups every person is different and how they see themselves is different.

## When introducing the community

Use:\
“People who are chronically ill, disabled, D/deaf, neurodivergent or have a mental health condition.”

* Chronically ill refers to people with long term illness, so things like: Chronic fatigue (ME/CFS), Long COVID, Diabetes, Cancer.
* D/deaf refers to inclusion of Hard of Hearing people and the [Deaf community](https://www.nad.org/resources/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-frequently-asked-questions/).
* Mental health condition refers to things like: Depression, Anxiety.
* Neurodivergent refers to things like: ADHD, Autism, Tourettes etc.

Try to:

* Focus on lived experience over requiring diagnosis.
* Avoid excluding some groups, e.g. disabled and neurodivergent, if too long, use ‘disabled’.

### Why?

* Helps people see themselves - not everyone calls themself ‘disabled’.
* We make it clear who is welcome without making people figure it out themselves.
* Diagnosis can be expensive, time consuming, and not needed for some people. We trust that people know what their needs are and support them where they’re at.

## When talking about the community

Use “Disabled Hippos”, “Disabled community at Hippo” or #disabled-hippos.

Use this when:

* you’ve already introduced the community.
* you do not have time or it’s inappropriate to give the expanded version.

### Why?

We are pro-disability, while not everyone calls themselves ‘disabled’, it avoids things like “differently abled”, “special” which can erase disability.

Some distance from disability is down to ableism which we can challenge as a group.
