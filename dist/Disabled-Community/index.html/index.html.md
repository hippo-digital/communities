# Disabled Community

Space for disabled Hippos to support each other and chat.

Includes people who are chronically ill, disabled, D/deaf, neurodivergent or have a mental health condition.

We focus on life experience, no diagnosis needed

## How to join

We have a private Slack channel so people can feel comfortable sharing their experiences and as a group we do not share people’s identities or experiences wider without consent.

We currently have over 30 people in the group.

To join the Slack channel, message [Sophie Strong](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/team/U0397PJHKE0) or [Dani Massarano](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/team/U05D5CPSGSZ)

You will be asked to read and agree to the [community rules](/Disabled-Community-Rules/).

Not joined Hippo but want to talk to disabled community members? You can email Sophie Strong <sophie.strong@hippodigital.co.uk>
