# Words to avoid when talking about disabled people

When talking about an individual, ask them “How do you refer to your disability or impairment?“.

When talking about a broad group use ‘disabled people’ or ‘people with disabilities’.

## When identifying a disabled person

There is no right way for people to identify with their disability or impairment, however some terms are insensitive or offensive.

## In everyday language

Not all disabled people find these words offensive, it is okay to make mistakes, focus on speaking with more intention and improving over time.

Avoid words that reference disabled people when it is unrelated to your point.

| Instead of saying   | Try instead                                            | Why?                                                                                     |

| Stupid, Idiot, Dumb | Nonsense, Ignorant                                     | Insults around intelligence are often used when we could argue against a specific point. |
| Lame                | Boring, Sad                                            | Avoid conflating motor impairments with something bad.                                   |
| “I’m so OCD”        | I’m fixated on \[thing], I’m particular about \[thing] | OCD is a serious mental health condition and should not be trivialised.                  |

## Disabled community reclaiming words

Some disabled people may use these words to describe themselves.

For example, ‘Crip’ is used amongst many disabled people, similar to how ‘queer’ has been reclaimed by the LGBT+ community.

If you are not from these communities then avoid them even if they’re used by the person themselves.
