# Green Hippos

**First of all, welcome to the Green Hippos community!**

We started “Green Hippos” with the aim of building a community that will encourage Hippo to become more sustainable.

If you have questions about the Green Hippos community or anything on this drive, get in touch with [Heather Paxton](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/team/U01DM46RZ5K) or [Steve Saunders](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/team/U04NGST4JCW).

## The community is for:

Everyone!

It’s especially for those who want to find like-minded individuals who are, or are interested and **trying to live a more sustainable lifestyle**.

We sometimes call ourselves Grippos (Green Hippos), but that is not mandatory.

## The community is here to:

* Educate, grow awareness and promote sustainable practices
* Support Hippos goal to be a [Net Zero business by 2025](https://hippodigital.co.uk/carbon-reduction-plan/)
* Consider the impact of Hippo and ourselves on the environment
* Encourage Hippos to live a greener lifestyle
* Support those making changes
* Celebrate sustainable activities of people within the community
* Support other communities within Hippo
* Make Hippo and the planet better for everyone
