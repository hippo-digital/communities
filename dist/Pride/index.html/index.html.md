# Pride

A space for LGBTQ+ Hippos and allies.

## How to join

You can:

* join the public LGBTQ+ and allies [#pride channel on Slack](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C03PPATBYNA)
* email [Adam Clarkson](mailto:henry.cookson@hippodigital.co.uk) or [Dani Massarano](mailto:dan.massarano@hippodigital.co.uk) to be added to the private channel for LGBTQ+ people

We have a call on the first Tuesday of each month. Details about how to join are pinned in the [#pride channel on Slack](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C03PPATBYNA).

## I’m an ally, how can I help?

An ally is a person who confronts heterosexism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and heterosexual privilege in themselves and others out of concern for the well-being of LGBTQ+ people.

Simply calling yourself an ‘ally’ of the LGBTQ+ community is not enough. It requires active participation and notable gestures of support for the people around you. A good ally understands how to lift up not just broad LGBTQ+ voices but black LGBTQ+ voices, LGBTQ+ sex workers’ voices, and trans people’s voices, among other marginalised LGBTQ+ identities.

As an ally, you can:

* join the [#pride channel on Slack](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C03PPATBYNA) to keep updated on key events and experiences
* not make assumptions about people’s sexuality and gender identity\
  be open, honest and apologise if you make a mistake such as using someone’s wrong pronoun
* call out discriminatory language and behaviour to Hippo leadership
* further call out discriminatory language and behaviour outside of work. The LGBT Foundation provides [guidance on what to do if you experience or witness discrimination](https://lgbt.foundation/report)
* highlight where Hippo Digital policies, documentation and procedure need amending to support LGBTQ+ colleagues
* offer your advice and time to LGBTQ+ colleagues when they need support around their sexuality and gender identity
* ensure your preferred pronouns are included in your Slack profile and email signature. For example: “My preferred pronouns are: they/them/theirs | [Why have I included this?](https://medium.com/gender-inclusivit/why-i-put-pronouns-on-my-email-signature-and-linkedin-profile-and-you-should-too-d3dc942c8743)”
* actively seek out ways to further your education and understanding of the LGBTQ+ community and the challenges they may face. Stonewall’s [allyship page](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/resource-topic/allies) and their [Coming Out for LGBT page](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/come-out-lgbt-becoming-active-lgbt-ally) are good places to start
